# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research

We pursue [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) to the fullest extent possible in every project.
We strive for creativity, integrity, inclusivity, and rigor in everything that we do.
For a complete list of all up-to-date projects, see our [lab's github organization](https://github.com/WayScience).

We submit preprints of our work and subsequently publish in peer-reviewed journals to disseminate knowledge more formally around the world.
For each project, we also share project-specific github repositories (representing a lab notebook) to facilitate computational reproducibility.
Biology is messy, but computational biology need not be!
